# Overview

Do you like terraform stations from my mod [Aesthetic Terraform Stations](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2622411084)?  Do you also want to have properly-skinned terraform stations for the [Enigmatic Shipset](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2545512457)?  Then this mod is for you!

MadamLava hand-crafted a special model just for terraform stations - available only with this mod!

# Changes

Adds a terraform station definition with an active terraforming beam for graphical culture `aoshtai_01`, required for Aesthetic Terraform Stations to apply the correct appearance.

## Compatibility

Should work with practically everything that also works with Enigmatic Shipset and Aesthetic Terraform Stations.  This mod is technically achievement compatible, but its dependencies are not.

Built for Stellaris version 3.2.\* "Herbert."

### Required Dependency Mods

[Aesthetic Terraform Stations](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2622411084) enables the very old-school terraform stations as visual markers for terraforming planets.

[Enigmatic Shipset](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2545512457) for the original graphics and other ship-related code.

## Changelog

* 1.0.0 Initial version
* 1.1.0 Mark as compatible with Stellaris version 3.2 "Herbert" - no script changes
* 1.2.0 New, unique model for the Enigmatic terraform station - made by MadamLava herself!

### Development Notes

It is best to clone this repository into `<Stellaris User's Directory>/Paradox Interactive/Stellaris/mod`, and then make a connection to the `mod` folder via a `*.mod` file's `path` property.  That will ensure the game can see the files, and also that CWTools will parse them.  Also note that the README.md file exists in the `mod` directory but is symbolically linked in the root directory.
