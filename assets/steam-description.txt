MadamLava hand-crafted a special model just for terraform stations - available only with this mod!

[h1]Changes[/h1]
Adds a terraform station definition with an active terraforming beam for graphical culture [b]aoshtai_01[/b], required for Aesthetic Terraform Stations to apply the correct appearance.

Should work with practically everything that also works with Enigmatic Shipset and Aesthetic Terraform Stations.  This mod is technically achievement compatible, but its dependencies are not.

Built for Stellaris version 3.6 "Orion" and backwards-compatible with versions 3.5 "Fornax," 3.4 "Cepheus," 3.3 "Libra," 3.2 "Herbert," 3.1 "Lem", and 3.0 "Dick."
